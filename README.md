# JD-Style
Toolkit for developping in HTML/CSS. Facilitates the integration of html pages by gathering a set of class used in all integration projects.

I used this style sheet in addition to Bootstrap before he integrate class to control positions, margins and element sizes. It allowed me to quickly start projects by configuring commonly used class.

## Utilities
  
  <ul>
    <li>a.opaque</li>
    <li>a.cursor</li>
    <li>loader</li>
    <li>fontX - from 6 to 120</li>
    <li>uppercase</li>
    <li>lowercase</li>
  </ul>
